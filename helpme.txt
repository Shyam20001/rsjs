Yes, if you want to use `p-limit` (the simplest and safest way to control async concurrency in Node.js), you'll need to install it via npm:

---

### ‚úÖ Install `p-limit`:

```bash
npm install p-limit
```

Or globally (not usually recommended for libraries):

```bash
npm install -g p-limit
```

---

### üîç What is `p-limit`?

* A lightweight NPM package from the `sindresorhus` ecosystem
* Limits how many promises run in parallel
* Works great for "fire-and-forget with a safety net"

---

### üí° Example with `p-limit` (after install):

```js
const fs = require('fs/promises');
const path = require('path');
const pLimit = require('p-limit');

const limit = pLimit(50); // Max 50 concurrent writes
let fileCounter = 1;

const fireAndForgetWriteFile = async (data) => {
    const filename = `test${fileCounter++}.txt`;
    const content = `Timestamp: ${new Date().toISOString()}\nData: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`;
    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'test', filename);

    // Launch with limit ‚Äî no await needed here
    limit(async () => {
        try {
            await fs.writeFile(filePath, content, 'utf8');
            console.log(`‚úÖ Wrote ${filename}`);
        } catch (err) {
            console.error(`‚ùå Failed to write ${filename}:`, err.message);
        }
    })();
};
```

Let me know if you want a version that doesn't need external packages ‚Äî I can build a custom concurrency limiter too.
